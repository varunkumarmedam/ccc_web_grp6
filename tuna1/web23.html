<p style="color:orange;">The orange is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus × sinensis in the family Rutaceae.[1] It is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.[2][3][4][5</p>
