	<h1 class="h1">My Hobbies</h1>
	<div class="p">
	<p >My name is Sridevi.R.My hobbies include <strong>watching TV,playing logical and verbal games and reading some good articles</strong> for improvig my english accent.Whenever i watch TV i feel so enjoyed,I show more interest on good english movies and news channels.I love to watch Inspiring and Motivating Movies.</p><br />
		<p>Apart from watching TV I will spend my leisure time by playing games which improve my logical and verbal skills. I will be downloading only such kind of games from playstore.
	And also i used to play quiz games downloading from playstore eventhough most of my answers will be wrong i feel that i learnt something because when i make a mistake i remember it more than when i give a correct  answer.</p><br />
	<p>And next will be my most favourite hobby. i always have a deep craze towards british english accent.I really like their slang,their stylish speech. Mostly i will read more english articles and when i find some new words i note it down .I prefer many Translator app and IELTS app because it gives a good idea of creative writing.Eventhough I do many things as my hobbies reading english articles and referring some communication skills app will be the first because of my strong love to improve my good speaking skills.</p><br />
	<p>Having hobbies will give a good habits and it will make us engaged without being idle .When we have a habit of being idle it will make us not to concentrate  on any work. so do something which  you love to do like <strong>George Bernard Shaw</strong> quoted that<br /><br /><br />
